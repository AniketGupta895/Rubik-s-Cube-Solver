# Rubik's cube

___
A python program that can solve a rubik's cube.


### About this project
I explored this project in the summer of this year, as a self project for fun. It was a simple implementation of the beginner's method but it can be easily extended to other methods since the basic framework is ready. Can obviously be integrated with automated scripts for solving thousands of scrambles in no time. This was not a git repo before, it was there on my computer. Added to GitHub today.
